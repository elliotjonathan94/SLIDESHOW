<aside class="notes">
Rivers, lakes, streams, and oceans are all viable places to launch and enjoy kayaking with good weather. I have personally kayaked in all three regions of the state of NC and have seen much of the natural beauty that the state has to offer, and I hope to expand my horizons further in the future.River

<aside class="notes"> Kayaking offers a range of exercise capabilities. Paddling through moving or still water will offer a good workout to the arms and the abdomen of whoever is operating the boat. The workout can be pretty well rounded too, because lifting your kayak up and down to load and unload can get your blood flowing too. You don't have to worry about being bored while you workout, because you'll be enjoying yourself and not overworking to the point of exhaustion or shortness of breath.</aside>
