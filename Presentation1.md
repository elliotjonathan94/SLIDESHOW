<aside class="notes">
Rivers, lakes, streams, and oceans are all viable places to launch and enjoy kayaking with good weather. I have personally kayaked in all three regions of the state of NC and have seen much of the natural beauty that the state has to offer, and I hope to expand my horizons further in the future.River

# Exercise
Tired of all that monotonous running?

<aside class="notes"> Kayaking offers a range of exercise capabilities. Paddling through moving or still water will offer a good workout to the arms and the abdomen of whoever is operating the boat. The workout can be pretty well rounded too, because lifting your kayak up and down to load and unload can get your blood flowing too. You don't have to worry about being bored while you workout, because you'll be enjoying yourself and not overworking to the point of exhaustion or shortness of breath.</aside>
# Fishing

<aside class="notes"> I love to fish, and so do a large population of Americans, and maybe even some of you. Fishing from the shore is often boring and difficult, you have to watch out for trees and small animals like snakes. Fishing from a boat is a step up, because you have more access and less danger to worry about. In my opinion, fishing from a kayak is the best way to fish. Being in such a small manually powered vessel allows you access to many more places that other fishermen cant get to. Boat motors get clogged up in heavy vegetation, and often get damaged in shallow or rocky water. Not a kayak.</aside>
# It's easy!

<aside class="notes"> Even the most uncoordinated of individuals can learn to kayak in less than fifteen minutes. The boats are designed for exceptionally easy balance, especially in calm water. Things can get a little rough with a current and some rapids, but with a little experience it is no harder than riding your bike</aside>
# Seriously

<aside class="notes"> It is really hard to end up in a position like these kids. They must have made some sort of atrocious mistake to end up like that! Stil though, they aren't sinking very quickly and will easily be able to remove themselves from the boat and swim to shore. I doubt anything like this will every happen to anyone else!</aside>
